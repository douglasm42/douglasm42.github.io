Built this to help me playing this PS1 game. I played this a lot when I was a kid.
It's a very simple game, but it requires you to grind for powerful cards and it's
very unclear where you are supposed to go to get what you want.

With this tool you can look-up the cards that you want and check how to get it.

It also have a fusion calculator and guardian stars advantages map.

It's missing a few stuff, like a guide on how to get S-Tec rank, and it's also looking kind of ugly.
