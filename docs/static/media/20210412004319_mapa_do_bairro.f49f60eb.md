The name means: map of the neighborhood. It was the last project of a front-end course that I took on Udacity.
The challenge was to create a SPA using the Google Maps API to draw a map of my neighborhood and mark some
points of interest in it. And it should have integration with another API to get more details about that point,
I chose the Wikipedia for this, so the app get the introduction about the point of interest to be shown.

For this I used ReactJS and learned to use it.
