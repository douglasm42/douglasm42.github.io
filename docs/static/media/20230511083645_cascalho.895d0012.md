This is a personal financing application. I built it to help me organize my bills,
payments and to know how much money I have available for the next months and years.
I used Ruby on Rails and a bit of Javascript to achieve it. As this is just a sketch
to test the idea and I would be rewriting it anyways, I wrote it without using tests,
so this project is not stable.

Cascalho is a slang for money.
